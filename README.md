# py_maze

A repository for the code I write while working through the textbook
["Mazes for Programmers"](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/)
by Jamis Buck.

Any individual maze generation algorithm can be run directly from the
file with the corresponding name (e.g. `python sidewinder.py`).

To see an example for each algorithm with any notable characteristics listed
use the demo file by running `python demo.py`.
